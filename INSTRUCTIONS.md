## Technologies Used
- MySQL
- Sequelize
- Express

## Description
This code is the backend to an e-commerce website and allows users to access to utilize an Express.js APPI in order to interact with a database of tags, products and categories of MYSQL data. 

All data can be ran through insomnia to verify the code is working properly and can connect and display appropriately to the webpage.

## Known Bugs and Future Improvements
The code is working. There could be more organization in the future with how items are added to products, tags, and categories.
